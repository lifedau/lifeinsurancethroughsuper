## Step 1: Check Your Current Coverage

### How to Access Your Super Insurance Information

Before making any decisions about your life insurance, it's essential to understand what coverage you currently have through your superannuation. Here's how to check your existing coverage:

#### Online Access
Most super funds provide online portals or mobile apps where you can view your insurance details:

1. Log in to your super fund's member portal or app
2. Navigate to the "Insurance" or "Cover" section
3. Review your current coverage amount, premium costs, and policy details
4. Look for information about policy exclusions and expiry age
5. Check if your death benefit nomination is current and binding

#### Contact Your Fund
If you can't access your information online or need clarification:

1. Call your super fund's customer service line
2. Request a copy of your insurance policy document
3. Ask for a statement of your current coverage and premiums
4. Inquire about any special conditions or exclusions
5. Confirm your current beneficiary nominations

#### Request Documentation
For a complete understanding of your coverage, request these key documents:

1. Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) for insurance
2. Insurance policy document or member booklet
3. Current benefit statement showing coverage amounts
4. Schedule of premiums and fees
5. Death benefit nomination form

### What to Look For

When reviewing your current coverage, pay special attention to these critical details:

#### Coverage Amounts
- Death cover (life insurance) amount
- Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) coverage amount
- Income protection coverage (if applicable)
- Whether these amounts are fixed or linked to your salary

#### Policy Terms
- TPD definition ("any occupation" vs. "own occupation")
- Exclusions and limitations
- Expiry age
- Continuation options if you change jobs
- Conditions for coverage while unemployed

#### Premium Details
- Current premium amount
- How premiums are calculated (stepped vs. level)
- Premium trend over time
- Impact on your super balance

#### Beneficiary Arrangements
- Current death benefit nominations
- Whether nominations are binding or non-binding
- Expiry date of nominations
- Trustee discretion provisions

### Documentation Checklist

## Step 2: Assess Your Coverage Needs

### Using the Coverage Calculator

Our calculator helps you determine how much life insurance coverage you actually need based on your specific circumstances. To get an accurate assessment:

1. Gather information about your financial situation
2. Consider your family's specific needs and goals
3. Be realistic about future expenses and inflation
4. Account for existing assets and other insurance policies

### Key Factors to Consider

When assessing your coverage needs, consider these important factors:

#### Income Replacement
How many years of income would your family need if you were no longer able to provide? Consider:
- Your current annual income
- Your partner's income (if applicable)
- Expected career progression
- Number of years until children are financially independent
- Retirement plans and timeline

Most financial experts recommend replacing 70-80% of your income for 5-10 years.

#### Debt Obligations
What debts would need to be paid off to ensure your family's financial security? Include:
- Mortgage balance
- Car loans
- Credit card debt
- Personal loans
- Student loans
- Business loans
- Other financial obligations

Clearing these debts immediately would remove significant financial pressure from your family.

#### Education Costs
If you have children, factor in their future education expenses:
- Remaining primary and secondary education costs
- University or vocational training expenses
- Postgraduate education if planned
- Educational support services
- Educational materials and technology

University education in Australia can cost $20,000-$45,000 per year including living expenses.

#### Final Expenses
Include costs associated with end-of-life arrangements:
- Funeral and burial/cremation costs ($4,000-$15,000)
- Outstanding medical bills
- Estate administration expenses
- Legal fees

#### Existing Assets and Resources
Subtract resources already available to your family:
- Current savings and investments
- Other life insurance policies
- Existing superannuation balance
- Investment properties
- Shares and other investments

### Understanding Your Coverage Gap

After completing the calculator, you'll receive a detailed analysis of your coverage gapâ€”the difference between your current insurance and your recommended amount.

For most Australians with default super insurance, this gap is approximately 75% of their actual needs. This means your family would receive only about a quarter of the financial support they would need if something happened to you.

## Step 3: Understand Your Options

### Option 1: Increase Your Super Insurance

Many super funds allow you to increase your default coverage amount, which can be a simple first step toward improving your protection.

#### Pros:
- Convenience of automatic premium payments from your super balance
- May not require medical underwriting for small increases
- Premiums paid from pre-tax super contributions
- Simple application process through your existing fund
- No need to establish a separate policy

#### Cons:
- Still subject to all super insurance limitations
- May have coverage caps or restrictions
- Reduces your retirement savings
- Limited flexibility in policy terms
- Tax implications for non-dependent beneficiaries remain
- Usually only offers stepped premiums

#### How to Apply:
1. Contact your super fund or log in to your online account
2. Request an increase in your coverage amount
3. Complete any required health questionnaires
4. Review and accept the new premium amount
5. Confirm the effective date of your increased coverage

### Option 2: Purchase Retail Life Insurance

Retail life insurance policies offer more comprehensive coverage and greater flexibility, addressing many of the limitations of super insurance.

#### Pros:
- Comprehensive coverage with better benefits
- Guaranteed renewable until expiry age (typically 99)
- Tax-free payouts to any beneficiary
- More flexible coverage options
- "Own occupation" TPD definitions available
- Level premium options for long-term cost stability
- Additional benefits like funeral advancements

#### Cons:
- Requires medical underwriting
- Premiums paid from after-tax income
- Separate policy to manage
- Higher initial premiums (especially for level premium options)
- More complex application process

#### How to Apply:
1. Research insurance providers or consult with a financial advisor
2. Compare policy features and premium costs
3. Complete the application and health questionnaire
4. Undergo medical examination if required
5. Review and accept the policy terms
6. Set up premium payment method

### Option 3: Retail Insurance Through Super

This hybrid approach allows you to maintain the tax advantages of super funding while gaining the better coverage of retail policies.

#### Pros:
- Better coverage than default super insurance
- Premiums paid from super balance
- Tax advantages of super funding
- Potential for "own occupation" TPD definitions
- More flexible policy terms than default super insurance
- Option for level premiums in many cases

#### Cons:
- Still subject to some super restrictions
- Reduces retirement savings
- May have tax implications for beneficiaries
- Requires coordination between insurer and super fund
- Not all super funds offer this option

#### How to Apply:
1. Check if your super fund allows external insurance policies
2. Research insurance providers or consult with a financial advisor
3. Apply for a retail policy with super ownership
4. Complete health questionnaires and medical examinations
5. Set up a premium deduction authority with your super fund
6. Confirm the arrangement is properly established

### Combination Approach

Many financial advisors recommend a combination approach that leverages the advantages of both super and retail insurance:

1. Maintain some basic coverage through your super
2. Supplement with a retail policy for comprehensive protection
3. Structure ownership to maximize tax efficiency
4. Review and adjust the balance as your needs change

This approach provides both convenience and comprehensive protection while optimizing tax outcomes.

## Step 4: Get Professional Advice

### The Value of Financial Advice

While online resources provide valuable information, personalized financial advice can make a significant difference in your insurance outcomes:

#### Benefits of Professional Advice:
- Tailored recommendations based on your specific situation
- Expertise in navigating complex insurance options
- Access to a wider range of products and providers
- Assistance with application and underwriting process
- Ongoing support and policy reviews
- Coordination with broader financial planning

#### When Advice Is Particularly Valuable:
- Complex family or financial situations
- Pre-existing health conditions
- High-risk occupations or activities
- Business ownership considerations
- Estate planning requirements
- Tax optimization needs

### Finding the Right Advisor

Not all financial advisors are equal when it comes to insurance expertise:

#### Advisor Qualifications:
- Look for advisors with specific life insurance qualifications
- Check their Financial Adviser Register listing on ASIC's MoneySmart website
- Confirm they have an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL)
- Ask about their experience with insurance cases similar to yours
- Inquire about their continuing education in insurance

#### Questions to Ask Potential Advisors:
1. What is your experience with life insurance advice?
2. How do you determine appropriate coverage amounts?
3. What range of insurance providers do you work with?
4. How are you remunerated for insurance advice?
5. What ongoing service do you provide after policy implementation?
6. Can you provide client references or testimonials?

#### Fee Structures:
- Fee-for-service (hourly rate or fixed fee)
- Commission-based (paid by the insurer)
- Hybrid models (combination of fees and commissions)
- Ongoing service fees for policy reviews and management

Understanding how your advisor is paid helps you assess potential conflicts of interest and value for money.

### What to Expect from the Advice Process

A comprehensive insurance advice process typically includes:

1. **Initial Consultation:** Discussing your situation, goals, and concerns
2. **Needs Analysis:** Detailed assessment of your insurance requirements
3. **Strategy Development:** Creating a tailored insurance strategy
4. **Product Research:** Identifying suitable policies and providers
5. **Recommendation:** Formal advice document outlining recommendations
6. **Implementation:** Assistance with applications and underwriting
7. **Ongoing Review:** Regular reassessment of your coverage needs

This structured approach ensures your insurance strategy remains appropriate as your life circumstances change.

## Common Questions

### Will I lose my current coverage if I switch?

It's important not to cancel your existing coverage until your new policy is fully approved and in force. When applying for retail insurance, you'll typically have a period where both policies overlap. Once your new policy is active, you can then cancel your super insurance or reduce it to a complementary level.

Some super funds also offer continuation options that allow you to maintain coverage when changing jobs or funds, but these often require action within a specific timeframe (typically 30-60 days).

### What if I have pre-existing health conditions?

Pre-existing conditions may affect your ability to obtain new coverage or may result in exclusions or premium loadings. However, many conditions can still be covered, especially if well-managed. Options include:

1. **Disclosure and standard rates:** Some conditions may be accepted without any changes to standard premiums
2. **Premium loadings:** Paying an additional percentage on standard premiums to cover the increased risk
3. **Specific exclusions:** Coverage for everything except claims related to the specific condition
4. **Deferred assessment:** Coverage with a review after a specified period of successful management

It's best to speak with a financial advisor who can help you navigate the underwriting process and find insurers who may be more accommodating for your specific condition.

### Can I have both super and retail insurance?

Yes, you can have both types of coverage simultaneously. Many people maintain a basic level of coverage through their super while supplementing with a retail policy for more comprehensive protection. This approach can provide a balance between convenience and comprehensive coverage.

When structuring multiple policies, consider:
- Total coverage amounts across all policies
- Coordination of benefit provisions
- Premium costs and payment methods
- Tax implications for different ownership structures
- Disclosure requirements between policies

Just be careful not to over-insure, as most policies will take other coverage into account when paying claims.

### How do I pay for retail insurance through my super?

To pay for retail insurance through your super, you'll need to set up a "premium deduction authority" that allows your super fund to pay your insurance premiums directly to the insurer. This arrangement needs to be established when you apply for the policy.

The process typically involves:
1. Applying for a retail policy with super fund ownership
2. Completing a premium deduction authority form
3. Submitting the form to your super fund
4. Confirming the arrangement is properly established
5. Monitoring premium payments to ensure continuity

Not all super funds offer this option, so check with your fund first. Alternatively, you can make additional contributions to your super to offset the premium deductions.

### What happens to my insurance if I change jobs?

The impact of changing jobs depends on your insurance type:

**Default Super Insurance:**
- Coverage typically ends when you stop contributing to that fund
- New employer's fund will have different default coverage
- May require medical underwriting to reinstate similar coverage
- Often results in coverage gaps or reductions

**Retail Insurance:**
- Continues unchanged regardless of employment changes
- Premium payments continue as established
- No impact on coverage terms or conditions
- No new underwriting required

**Retail Through Super:**
- Continues as long as premium payments continue
- May need to arrange contributions to the original fund
- Can usually be transferred to a new super fund if needed
- Requires proactive management during job transitions

To minimize disruption, plan any job changes carefully and consider how they might affect your insurance coverage.

## Success Stories

### Sarah's Story: From Underinsured to Protected

Sarah, a 38-year-old marketing manager from Sydney, discovered her super insurance would only cover 30% of her family's needs after using our calculator. With a mortgage of $650,000 and two young children, she was shocked to learn her default coverage of $250,000 would leave her family with significant financial hardship.

Working with a financial advisor, Sarah implemented a combined approach:
- Maintained $250,000 coverage through her super
- Added a $600,000 retail policy with level premiums
- Structured the retail policy for tax-free benefits to any beneficiary
- Set up binding nominations for both policies

"The peace of mind is worth every cent," Sarah says. "I sleep better knowing my family would be financially secure if anything happened to me."

**Result:** Increased total coverage from $250,000 to $850,000 with guaranteed renewability and no tax implications for beneficiaries.

### Michael's Story: Protecting Adult Children

Michael, a 45-year-old electrician from Melbourne, was shocked to learn that his adult children would be taxed on his super insurance payout. With two children in university, he wanted to ensure they would receive his full benefit without tax deductions.

After consulting with a financial advisor, Michael:
- Switched to a retail policy for the majority of his coverage
- Maintained a smaller amount through super for his wife (a dependent beneficiary)
- Established clear binding nominations for both policies
- Set up level premiums to maintain affordability as he ages

"By switching to a retail policy, I ensured my children would receive the full benefit tax-free, while still maintaining some coverage through my super for my wife."

**Result:** Eliminated potential $120,000 tax bill for beneficiaries while maintaining the same premium cost through a combination approach.

### Lisa's Story: Avoiding Cancellation Risk

Lisa, a 42-year-old teacher from Brisbane, planned to take 12 months of unpaid leave to care for her elderly parent. What she didn't realize was that her super insurance would be cancelled after 16 months without contributions, potentially leaving her uninsured when she returned to work.

After researching her options, Lisa:
- Applied for a retail policy before starting her leave
- Structured it with an ownership split between super and personal
- Made arrangements for minimum super contributions during her leave
- Set up automatic premium payments to ensure continuity

"I had no idea my super insurance could be cancelled while I was on leave. Getting a retail policy gave me the security of knowing my coverage would continue regardless of my employment situation."

**Result:** Maintained continuous coverage during extended leave and secured guaranteed renewable insurance regardless of future career changes.
