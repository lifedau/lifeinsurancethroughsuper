# Project Analysis for LifeInsuranceThroughSuper.com.au

## Project Objective
To create an educational, interactive website that informs Australians about life insurance through superannuation, highlighting its limitations and comparing it to retail and direct life insurance policies. The website aims to encourage users to assess their current coverage, understand potential risks, and consider better alternatives.

## Target Audience
1. Australians with default life insurance through their superannuation fund
2. People unaware of the limitations of their existing coverage
3. Individuals looking to improve or transfer their life insurance for better benefits

## Key Messages to Communicate
1. **Coverage Inadequacy**:
   - Life insurance through super provides only basic coverage, often inadequate
   - Many Australians are underinsured by approximately 75%
   - Default policies may not be cheaper due to broad coverage of higher-risk individuals

2. **Policy Limitations**:
   - Not guaranteed renewable - coverage can change or stop without notice
   - Payout restrictions - limited beneficiaries and trustee discretion applies
   - Tax implications - up to 32% tax for non-dependent beneficiaries
   - Slower claims process compared to retail policies
   - Earlier expiration than expected
   - General exclusions that policyholders are often unaware of
   - No level premiums - costs increase with age
   - Risk of unknowing cancellation

3. **Specific Coverage Issues**:
   - TPD insurance lacks "own occupation" cover
   - Switching funds can lead to coverage loss and require medical underwriting
   - Income protection is limited (two years max, stops if unemployed, not tax-deductible)

4. **Retail Policy Advantages**:
   - Better benefits including funeral and accommodation advancements
   - More comprehensive coverage options
   - Can still be funded through super

## Required Website Features
1. **Interactive Calculator**: To help users determine their level of underinsurance
2. **Comparison Tool**: Visual comparison between super and retail life insurance policies
3. **Educational Content**: Clear explanations of policy differences
4. **Call to Action**: Encouraging users to check coverage and explore retail options
5. **User-Friendly Design**: Simple, modern UX/UI for complex information
6. **Citations & External Links**: All claims backed by reputable sources
7. **Statistics Page**: Dedicated section with data, graphs, and authoritative statistics

## Tone & Style Guidelines
- Informative yet engaging
- Clear and jargon-free language
- Trustworthy and authoritative voice
- Action-oriented without fear-mongering

## Technical Requirements
Based on the project needs, we will need to implement:
1. A responsive, modern web design
2. Interactive JavaScript components for the calculator and comparison tools
3. Data visualization capabilities for statistics
4. Form functionality for user input
5. SEO optimization for relevant traffic

## Development Approach
We will use Next.js as our framework due to its:
- Server-side rendering capabilities for better SEO
- Built-in routing for a multi-page educational site
- Support for interactive components
- Integration with Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## Next Steps
1. Define detailed site structure and user journey
2. Set up the development environment
3. Create wireframes and design mockups
4. Develop the frontend prototype
5. Create educational content
6. Implement interactive tools
7. Compile statistics and citations
8. Test, optimize, and deploy the website
